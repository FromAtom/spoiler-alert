# SPOILER ALERT!

Do you ever have spoilers and wish you could have them on your page in a way that wasn't annoying? With spoiler alert you can! Hide any text a bit of blurriness. Clicking reveals. Mouseover gives you a taste.

Should work on images and text. Works fine on iPhone. I have no idea if IE is supported, but, shouldn't be hard if it isn't.

## Demo
